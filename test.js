      "My name is Rehema. I was with my sister in the garden. My sister's name is Tina. I had a knife my sister had a book. We sat under a mango tree. We had nothing else to do. We began to read a story book. The story was very good. We were very happy to read it.  The mango dropped from the tree. Tina stood up. She ran to take it. She came back. She cut it with our knife and we began to eat it. It was sweet fruit. We sat again and went on to read our story.  Another mango dropped. It did not drop on our heads. I stood up and went to take it. It was a big mango. We cut it with our knife and ate it. We liked it. Then we went home. We told the story to our father and mother. They were happy to hear it. It is good to have fruit trees.",
